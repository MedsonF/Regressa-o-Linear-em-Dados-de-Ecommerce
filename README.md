# Linear Regression for Sales Analysis

## Description

### The ecommerce-customers database represents fictional data from an e-commerce company, where 500 customers are analyzed based on their average membership time, average time spent on the mobile app, average time spent on the website, and average time in-store sessions, and how these data relate to the annual spending volume.

## Libraries required for development:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn (sklearn)

## Script Explanation:

### The script is a series of exercises focused on the linear regression method to arrive at a final question: Do you think the company should focus more on its mobile app or its website?
### This is based on coefficients found in the study and exploratory data analysis.
